# Part II Summary

An effective transformation strategy must do more than articulate aspirational statements of ambition. Instead, it has to first diagnose the challenges at hand \(see Part I\), and then develop guiding policies that not only addresses the challenge, but also creates a source of lasting advantage.

Armed with these six pragmatic principles, you can develop a blueprint that your organization will use to guide your transformation efforts. We hope that you’ll see your blueprint as a suggestion, rather than a fixed plan, and commit to being agile in your execution as your circumstances change. Most of all, we hope you’ll see that anticipating change and knowing you’ll adapt your planning to meet it isn’t scary, or indicative of a lack of forethought — it’s a practical judgment call based on the real conditions of the digital world.

In Part III, we’ll explain how to move beyond the planning steps we’ve provided here into action, using a four step model we call Micro-Transformation.
