# Step four: experiment toward the next target condition

The last step in the Starter Kata requires teams to experiment toward the target condition in “steps”. As mentioned earlier, the path to the outcome is uncertain, and because our own understanding may be currently limited, it’s important that we stay focused on experimenting in small steps.

Through these small steps, not only will the outcomes become less uncertain, but our own knowledge will also increase and enable us to think rationally about what the next step might be.

Step four is fundamentally a process of following the scientific method, starting with a hypothesis and then testing that hypothesis objectively against information gathered to routinely compare the current and target conditions.

To do this, many teams use the well-known Plan-Do-Check-Act \(PDCA\) cycle which we’ve summarized in Table N below.

Table N: The four step PDCA cycle

As teams move through the PDCA cycle, they use the Improvement Board shown in Figure N to keep track of their overall progress as well as to guide their daily Coaching Kata discussions.

During the daily coaching discussions, and at the beginning of each experimentation cycle, coaches will team the same five questions, which we’ve summarized below.

**The Five Coaching Kata Questions**

1. What is the target condition?
2. What is the actual, current condition?
3. What obstacles do you think are preventing you from reaching the target condition, and which one are you addressing now?
4. What is your next step?
5. How quickly can we go and see what we have learned from taking that step?
