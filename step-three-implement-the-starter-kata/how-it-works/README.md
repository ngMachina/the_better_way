# How it works

As shown in Figure N below, the Starter Kata has two main routines, known respectively as the Improvement Kata and the Coaching Kata.

The Improvement Kata provides coalitions and pods with a simple and repeatable way to achieve uncertain outcomes using a process that emphasizes short cycles, continuous improvement and scientific thinking.

The Coaching Kata is used to teach coalitions and pods how to _apply_ the Improvement Kata, as well as guide them through their experiments by asking the same five questions at the start of an experiment.  


_Note: We will explore the five questions in more detail later._

Figure N: The Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata working in parallel

As shown above, the Improvement Kata and the Coaching Kata are used together to help teams work through a two-phase process that includes the following four steps.

&lt;sidebar: The Starter Kata uses two key roles, known as “learners” and “coaches”. You can learn more about these roles in the [Appendix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bd9xRQQZfc-b9eTFUaAZQ7_KB7fiwk4MjWd5cErio_U/edit#)&gt;
