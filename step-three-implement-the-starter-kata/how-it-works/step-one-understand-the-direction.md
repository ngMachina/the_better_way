# Step one: understand the direction

The first step in the Improvement Kata requires coalitions, pods and coaches to gain a shared understanding of the organizational direction and key challenges at hand.

Generally, this can be accomplished by reviewing the following:

* The executive vision
* The business strategy and Lean Value Tree
* The transformational future state

Once understood, coalitions and pods can then work with IWE coaches to produce two artifacts. The first artifact is the team vision, which ideally incorporates elements of the broader organizational vision, strategy and future state, broken down to roughly three to five outcomes.

The second artifact is the “challenge” which represents a four- to eight-week “step” toward the vision. It’s important to highlight that in this context, a “step” represents part of the future state that you currently lack the capability to reach at the present time. We emphasize here that challenges are not problems, but are aspirational goals that begin by asking a simple question: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could...?” This distinction might seem subtle in some respects, but studies show that humans prefer to work on goals rather than problems. To better understand the difference, it may be helpful to refer to [Principle Six](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bd9xRQQZfc-b9eTFUaAZQ7_KB7fiwk4MjWd5cErio_U/edit#) in this book.
