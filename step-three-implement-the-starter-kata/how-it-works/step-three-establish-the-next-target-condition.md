# Step three: establish the next target condition

As mentioned above, the next step in the Starter Kata is to establish the next target condition. This step is intended to describe \(in measurable detail\) how you intend to move one “step” forward.

On this point, establishing the next target condition does not mean detailing how you will do it. That can only be determined through experimentation. Instead, the goal of establishing the target condition is simply to describe what the target condition might look like at a near-future date.

Without a target condition, many teams will engage in unproductive, unvalidated and vague solutioning debates rather than more structured discussions centered on validating assumptions.

One of the most effective ways for coalitions and pods to establish a target condition is to follow the “when, what, how” approach. In this case, _when_ represents the “achieve-by date”, _what_ represents a “measurable improvement metric” and _how_ represents “the new operating pattern” \(i.e. the future state\). Once the target condition has been established, coalitions and pods can use an Improvement Board like the one shown in Figure N below to help them visualize the work in process and track measurable improvement metrics from the current to target condition.

The Improvement Board is not only a visualization tool. It will also provide the focal point for daily coaching activities \(the Coaching Kata\), which we will explore in more detail in the next section.
