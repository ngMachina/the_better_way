# Step two: grasp the current condition

The next step in the Improvement Kata is _Grasp the Current Condition_. This step involves understanding the current state of the challenge through both objective and quantitative study. It’s not enough at this stage to simply define the current state using general observation or assumptions. Instead, this step requires both process analysis and gathering of quantifying data at organizational and value stream levels.

This is the only way to know what’s really going on. Through process analysis, you’ll be able to gain a better understanding of how processes and people inter-operate as well as baseline the current rate of performance, which can then be used to track progress as you move one “step” toward the target condition.
