# Preface

As exponential technological advancements, new business models, and ephemeral consumer appetites fuel demand for sophisticated, personalized and evolvable digital experiences, many organizations find they lack the strategy and capability needed to compete in the digital-first economy.

In fact, recent research [\[1\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md) suggests that a clear digital capability divide is forming, creating an increasingly high barrier to entry which cannot be overcome by throwing more money or people at the problem.

What’s more, many behind-the-curve organizations are waking up to the realization that there are no silver bullet solutions, and the problem cannot be outsourced or implemented as an ad hoc initiative.

Moreover, it’s important to note that transformation is not a one time event. Instead, it is a continual process of elaboration designed to build responsive organizations that employ adaptive mindsets to address change as it happens, and create customer value and business value at speed and scale.

But for established organizations, particularly those with large global footprints and roots that date back several generations, even modest changes are hard to implement due to their inherent scale and complexity.

For them, there are often far more questions than answers.

Where do we start? How much planning is appropriate? How will we allocate funds and resources? What are the key measures of success? While these are entirely reasonable questions to ask, we believe the best question to start with is “What will our future state look like?”

Answering this can be tricky. We’ve found it helps to approach the question from the right altitude. It’s got to be high enough that you can view the entire landscape and the interplay between culture, customers, competitors, ways of working, technological capability, etc., but low enough to spot transformative opportunities to deliver value in months, not years.

In this book, we want to help you find that altitude and uncover opportunities by distilling our real-world experience facing many of the challenges your organization is likely to encounter, and giving you actionable advice based on that experience.

Attempting to design your future state by copying what worked well for other organizations will not work for yours. In most cases, this approach is likely to backfire because your organization’s context is unique, even if the problem might seem similar.

For that reason, we prefer to guide with principles which are neither dogmatic nor rigid. They simply guide the path to a better way. They can be applied as much or as little as needed to as a means of wayfinding, calibrating and resolving transformation challenges as they are discovered.

To help make the principles real, we’ve included tools to guide your application of the principles in practice, get a sense of what ‘good’ looks like, and watch out for common failure modes. We’ve also included some sample case studies that are based on our own real world experience.

So no matter where you are on your transformation journey, we hope this eBook provides meaningful insight, utility and a sense of direction when times get tough—and they will. For those times, we hope you’ll return to the principles in this book.
