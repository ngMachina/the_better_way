# Profound complexity

### Organizational structures

Most companies today are “divided hierarchies”, a term coined by author Dave Gray in his book, [_The Connected Compan_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13628572-the-connected-company?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=myA7fm1K6r&rank=1)[_y_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13628572-the-connected-company?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=myA7fm1K6r&rank=1) __[\[6\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md).

In a divided hierarchy, work is essentially divided and distributed into zones, with each zone performing highly specific, repeatable and well-defined tasks that are delegated top-down using a command-and-control model.

Divided hierarchies are designed to create value by maximizing efficiency and scale, and they work exceptionally well in stable environments like manufacturing, where work is often routine, repetitive and knowable.

But divided hierarchies are much less effective when applied to unstable environments like digital, where value is generated by innovation, and the work is considerably more adaptive, dynamic and unknowable.

For transforming organizations, outdated organizational structures that are not fit for purpose can be a significant impediment. To become a truly digital enterprise, organizations must adopt an organizational structure that is designed to maximize the key enablers of innovation, i.e. high quality information flow, cross-functional collaboration and learning.

The solution is for organizations to transform their divided hierarchical organization into network based organizations which are designed to maximize autonomy, collaboration, and flow—the key enablers of innovation.

### Mindset & culture

As noted earlier, organizational challenges tend to be tightly coupled. This is particularly true of the relationship between organizational structures \(discussed above\) and organizational mindsets and culture.

Some might even say they are two sides of the same coin, with the key distinction being that organizational structure strongly influences how work flows \(how it is distributed and delivered\), while organizational culture strongly influences the mindset and behavior of those performing the work.

In our experience, rigid and hierarchical organizational structures tend to foster mindsets and cultures that reflect those traits, which are likely to manifest in beliefs and behaviours that are sub-optimal for an adaptive environment like digital.

This is because in adaptive environments, ambiguity is often high, and employees need to feel safe to ask questions, experiment, and apply divergent thinking in order to discover the right solutions for the challenge at hand.

In his 2014 paper entitled, [_A Typology of Organisational Culture_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1765804/pdf/v013p0ii22.pdf)[_s_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1765804/pdf/v013p0ii22.pdf) __[\[7\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md), sociologist Ron Westrum studied organizational culture in complex and risky environments and developed a typology he calls _The Three Cultures Model_. In it, Westrum’s findings indicated that organizations are largely either pathological, bureaucratic, or generative, based on the following traits.

| **Pathological** | **Bureaucratic** | **Generative** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Low cooperation | Modest cooperation | High cooperation |
| Messengers “shot” | Messengers neglected | Messengers trained |
| Responsibilities shirked | Narrow responsibilities | Risks are shared |
| Bridging discouraged | Bridging tolerated | Bridging encouraged |
| Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice | Failure leads to inquiry |
| Novelty crushed | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented |

**Table 1: Westrum's Typology of Organizational Culture**

One of Westrum’s key findings was that safety has a key predictive relationship in organizational performance, particularly in complex and risky environments, like digital innovation.

For transforming organizations, this is a key challenge that must not be overlooked. As noted earlier, digital enterprises create value through innovation, and innovation cannot succeed in an environment that is unfit for that purpose.

The solution is to develop a culture and mindset ecosystem that encourages behaviours that are fit for purpose and influence performance.

### Legacy technology

While outdated organizational structures and sub-optimal mindsets and cultures are significant challenges on their own, many organizations are also grappling with outdated and expensive systems and platforms.

At the heart of the challenge is the question of whether to modernize or outright replace many of the vital platforms and systems that underpin their daily operations.

It is a significant challenge that many enterprise organizations have historically avoided due to mounting technical debt linked to monolithic code bases and poor modularity.

Essentially, this challenge leaves leaders with a range of poor options to choose from. To rewrite their core applications from the ground up involves significant cost and risk, while the cost of doing nothing only increases by the day and further exacerbates the existing problem. Alternatively, they may choose the lesser evil and buy some time by incrementally reducing their technical debt, however the underlying issues remain the same.

This is often referred to as the legacy system trap.

Of course, this is not the only issue. As discussed throughout this book, a digital enterprise fundamentally creates its value by bringing innovative products and services to market, and this is hard to do when product teams are constrained by systems that cannot create the digital assets they require.

The solution is to prioritize customer value and incrementally modernize, replace or purchase only what is necessary to maximize and deliver that value, while implementing a longer term strategy to eliminate systems that are no longer fit for purpose.

### Budgeting

Just as fixed and divided hierarchies are ineffective when applied to adaptive working environments, so too, are fixed budgeting processes.

Digital is just too dynamic and fast-changing for an annual or even quarterly budgeting process to work. It’s simply too inflexible to be compatible with work that is emergent and unknowable. There are a number of challenges to cover under the heading of budgeting, but we will focus on three that must be addressed to enable a truly responsive digital enterprise.

The first challenge occurs during the annual budgeting process when managers are asked to produce high fidelity business cases based on nothing more than an untested hypothesis.

Generally, this lengthy and cumbersome process produces very little tangible value and often amounts to nothing more than an attempt to demonstrate due diligence and governance. But more than anything else, the annual budget approval process creates “lock-in” and leaves very little room to increase funding as value scales, or to redistribute funding to more promising opportunities.

This brings us to the second challenge, which is how funding is allocated. In most organizations, funding is typically allocated by department or function, which tends to further reinforce divided and hierarchical thinking and encourage local optimizations that are often unrelated to the broader business strategy.

Finally, perhaps the most vexing challenge of all, is that established companies tend to be highly risk averse and prefer to fund what they know. This often results in a reluctance to fund initiatives that are new or different.

The solution is to replace the lengthy low-value-adding annual budgeting process with an adaptive and incremental model that requires less upfront effort and determinism and only releases funding as value-based measures of success are achieved.
