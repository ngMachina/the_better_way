# Introduction

Radical change, rapid acceleration, profound complexity.

For most of us, these are the three themes that will shape our world for the foreseeable future.

It’s time to adapt.

For business leaders, the pressure to embrace technology and get ahead of the digital curve has been mounting for years. Though many have tried, for the most part, getting it right has proven elusive, if not downright vexing.

Nevertheless, companies everywhere are doubling down on digital transformation, with investments estimated to reach an eye popping [seven trillion dollars by](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/7-trillion-to-be-invested-in-making-work-more-digital-servicenow.html) [2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/7-trillion-to-be-invested-in-making-work-more-digital-servicenow.html).

And while most organizations will achieve some degree of success as long as they invest enough time, money and effort, the unfortunate reality is that the majority will fail to realize truly transformational results.

Why?

In our experience, when an organization fails to see results from their digital investments, it’s often because of a reluctance to change what’s working now, so they attempt to “transform” by implementing digital from the margins. But this approach fails because digital cannot be implemented from the margins. It must be integrated into the core of the organization, starting with the business strategy and operating model.

But even for those organizations that know they must become digital to the core, the question of course, is how? How do you integrate digital into the core of your business in a pragmatic way? How do you operate differently? And where do you start?

That's what this book will show you how to do.

In Part I, we will explore how radical changes in consumer preferences, rapid technological progress, and profound organizational complexity have combined to create a perfect storm that can only be solved by digitally transforming your operating model.

In Part II, we will outline five guiding principles you can use to build a responsive organization that is fit for purpose in the Digital Era.

Finally in Part III, we’ll introduce you to Rangle’s micro-transformation model, which enables organizations to apply an iterative and incremental approach to transformation that is pragmatic and human centred.

Taken together—or separately—each part can help you articulate and shape your organization's future state of design and strategy, as well as provide guidance and direction as you define your transformation strategy.
