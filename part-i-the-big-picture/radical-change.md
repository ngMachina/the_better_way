### Evolving consumer preferences

Consumers today have more choice than ever, and their loyalties are increasingly gravitating toward brands that offer personalized, evolvable and frictionless experiences across every touchpoint.

Not only that, but thanks to social media, the voice of the customer is exponentially louder than it has ever been, and this has fundamentally altered the power balance between brands and consumers.

As a result, companies today must embrace the notion that a world class digital customer experience is essential for survival.

This is because for consumers today, the high watermark of customer experience is not defined by those of your closest rivals—it's defined by every digital experience that exists in your customers’ digital ecosystem.

What this means is that organizations must do significantly more than simply ‘lift and shift’ an aging service to the cloud and apply some modest user interface enhancements.

Instead, companies must modernize the entire customer journey from end to end, ensuring that every experience is fast, personalized, and evolvable. Otherwise, your customers may become easy targets for motivated startups with clever and attractive new business models.

### Business model innovation

Consumers today are no longer starved for choice because there are literally thousands of well-funded upstarts coming to market each year with creative business models that offer better value and newer, more customized and differentiated experiences.

And so far, it seems that no field is immune. Fueled by technology, incumbents in every industry and vertical are finding themselves disrupted by the clever application of a technique known as decoupling, that is designed to break apart what Harvard professor Thales A. Teixeira refers to as “the customer value chain”. In his 2019 book entitled, [_Unlocking the Customer Value_ _Chain_ ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42934086-unlocking-the-customer-value-chain?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=yth8L6GHLf&rank=1)\_\_[\[3\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md), Teixeira describes how upstarts can disrupt incumbents by eliminating as many non-value added activities from the customer experience as possible.

Amazon provides a classic example of how to disrupt an established customer experience using this approach. In Amazon’s case, they successfully decoupled the traditional book purchasing experience by eliminating non-value adding activities from the existing customer experience. They did this by removing activities like travelling to the store, searching long stacks of books and waiting in line to pay, with value-adding activities like home delivery, digital search and one-click purchasing. With Kindle, their eBook service, they again applied digital technology to significantly increase customer time-to-value and scale competitive advantage.

There are many examples of this. Teixeira also points to how Netflix successfully offered customers an unrivalled entertainment experience in terms of variety, price and time to value, while leaving telecom providers to fulfill the costly and complex work of delivering internet connectivity service.

And while Amazon and Netflix are no longer upstarts, for incumbent organizations, the threat of new upstarts with similar potential will continue to pose a significant existential threat as interconnectivity between devices and lower transaction costs merge with unprecedented AI and automation capabilities.

What this means for incumbent organizations is that they must learn to disrupt, defend and differentiate in order to avoid becoming disrupted and displaced themselves.
