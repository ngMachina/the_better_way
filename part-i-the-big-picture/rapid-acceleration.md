### Exponential technological progress

“We live in exciting times of fundamental technological change” wrote Marc Benioff, the Chairman and CEO of Salesforce in the Foreword to 2014’s [_The Fourth Industrial Revolution_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28570175-the-fourth-industrial-revolution?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=PDiZWQeexB&rank=1) [\[4\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md), by Klaus Schwab.

Exciting times indeed. In fact, according to Schwab, the fourth industrial revolution will fundamentally, “alter the way we live, work and relate to one another. In its scale, scope and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.”

To get a sense of what the future will look like, consider this. In [_The Future Is Faster Than You Thin_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52290273-the-future-is-faster-than-you-think?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2tmh6G4w5t&rank=1)[_k_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52290273-the-future-is-faster-than-you-think?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2tmh6G4w5t&rank=1) [\[5\]](../endnotes/endnotes.md), authors Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler explain how Uber, among many others, are planning to solve the problem of urban mobility with aerial ride-sharing. Their plan is to have aerial ride sharing fully operational in some U.S. cities by 2023, with the ultimate goal of making owning a personal vehicle economically irrational. They plan to do this by finding ways to leverage technology to reduce the cost per mile.

But flying vehicles are just the tip of the iceberg, and many experts believe we are now at the tipping point of convergence, a point at which formerly independent streams of technology begin to exponentially scale and come together, enabling innovation to occur in ways we can’t even fully comprehend yet.

This means that as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, virtual reality and nanotechnology scale, so too will opportunities for leading organizations to catch the next wave of innovation and develop provocative new business models, products and services.
