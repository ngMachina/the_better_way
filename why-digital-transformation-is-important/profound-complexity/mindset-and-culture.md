# Mindset and culture

As noted earlier, organizational challenges tend to be tightly coupled and interdependent. This is particularly true of the relationship between organizational structures \(discussed above\) and organizational mindsets and culture. They are two sides of the same coin, with the key distinction being that organizational structure strongly influences how work flows \(i.e. how it is distributed and delivered\), while organizational culture strongly influences the mindset and behavior of those performing the work.

In our consulting experience, rigid and hierarchical organizational structures tend to foster mindsets and cultures that reflect those traits, which are likely to manifest in beliefs and behaviors that are sub-optimal for an adaptive environment like digital.

In adaptive environments, ambiguity is often high, and employees need to feel safe to ask questions, experiment and apply divergent thinking in order to discover the right solutions for the challenge at hand.

In his 2014 paper entitled, _A typology of organisational cultures_, sociologist and professor Ron Westrum studied organizational culture in complex and risky environments and developed a typology he calls _The Three Cultures Model_. In it, Westrum’s findings indicated that organizations are largely either pathological, bureaucratic or generative based on the following traits.

One of Westrum’s key findings was that safety has a key predictive relationship in organizational performance, particularly in complex and risky environments, i.e. digital innovation.

For transforming organizations, this is a key challenge that must not be overlooked. As noted earlier, digital enterprises create value through innovation, and innovation cannot succeed in an environment that either shoots the messenger or buries them in bureaucracy.
