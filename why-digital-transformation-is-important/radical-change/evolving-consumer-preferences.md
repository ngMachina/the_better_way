# Evolving consumer preferences

#### Evolving consumer preferences

Consumers today have more choice than ever, and their loyalties are increasingly gravitating toward brands that offer personalized, evolvable and frictionless experiences across every touchpoint.

Not only that, but thanks to modern digital technology and social media, the voice of the customer has grown exponentially louder than it has ever been, and this has fundamentally altered the power balance between brands and consumers.

As a result, companies today must embrace the notion that a world class digital customer experience is essential for survival. Because for consumers today, the high watermark of customer experience is not defined by those of your closest rivals — it's defined by every experience in your customer's “digital-everything” ecosystem.

What this means is that organizations must do significantly more than simply “lift and shift” their aging services to the cloud, and implement a few modest user interface enhancements. Instead, companies must continuously improve and modernize the entire customer experience from end-to-end, ensuring that every step in that experience is fast, personalized, and evolvable.
