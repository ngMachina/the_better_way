# How it works:

## Phase one: reinvention hypothesis

In Phase One, coalitions and pods work together to develop a hypothesis for how they might incorporate the principles and practices defined by the future state to deliver outcomes that contribute to key organizational goals.

Again, the principle of optionality is key. So rather than going all-in with one solution, coalitions and pods use hypothesis-driven methods to test a range of options and discover the best solution. To do this, they can work from the Opportunity Solution Tree presented in Principle Six to ensure their work maps to business outcomes on one or more potential opportunities and solutions.

## Phase two: scale and integrate

In Phase Two, coalition and pods take their validated hypothesis and attempt to scale it. Working with stakeholders who are both upstream and downstream in the process, these groups reach a target state by removing existing constraints that may inhibit the new ways of working and constrain the flow of work. Here, the functional side of the double-triangle can do a lot of the heavy lifting, as they have the seniority and institutional knowledge needed to help the pod reach the future state.

## Phase three: cement the new normal

In Phase Three, the coalition supports the pod as they cement the new ways of working, to the point that it becomes the new normal. At this pivotal point, the coalition can start working with a new pod and repeat the process \(using the lessons learned along the way to speed the implementation\).
