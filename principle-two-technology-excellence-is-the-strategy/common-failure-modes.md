# Common failure modes

* Organizing the enterprise by technology layer which inadvertently creates invisible bottlenecks and dependencies that reduce flow and value
* Using a “two-speed IT” model, which almost always lead to initiatives that move at the slowest possible speed, rather than the fastest
* Choosing tools over people. Tools help enable, but it's the people, process and shared outcomes that create real business impact
