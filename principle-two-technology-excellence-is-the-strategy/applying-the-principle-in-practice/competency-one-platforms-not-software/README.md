# Competency one: Platforms not software

Applying principle two in practice means starting with the first competency, which considers how your organization might apply Principles One and Two end-to-end, to improve high-value touchpoints in your customer experience. This is the intersection of strategy and technology combined into a platform that can evolve and scale to your digital ambitions.

As shown in Figure N below, meeting the two involves evaluating the customer experience and the activities that make up that experience from end to end, starting from the digital experience. This is comprised of devices, interfaces and user experience, and how they inter-operate with consumer touchpoints \(such as customer service and technical support\), followed by the back office operations that support that experience.

To get started on defining your platform strategy, the key question that must be answered is, “How might we strategically apply technology to incrementally improve the customer experience?”. It’s important to call out a few keywords here.

First, the term ‘strategic’ in this context means ensuring that every technology investment is aligned with Principle One, i.e. customer value and adaptability \(CVA\). Second, the term ‘incremental’ in this context means avoiding lengthy, big-bang technology solutions in favor of thinly-sliced, customer-centric outcome based initiatives like the one shown in Figure N which can deliver incremental measures of value in days or weeks, rather than months.

Figure N: Example of a thin-sliced, short cycle outcome

One of the keys to effective thin-slicing is to work backwards, think in terms of customers and outcomes, then determine how technology might be applied to improve the overall customer experience and increase customer time-to-value. For example, consider how an online travel management app might use technology to increase customer time-to-value within their travel booking systems by making experiences such as scheduling a trip, changing flights, or rescheduling as frictionless as possible across any device.

Applying this mindset can be tricky, but here’s a mindset shift from Harvard professor Ted Levitt: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole”. In other words, it's important to think about how technology can enable the outcomes that customers want. As Steve Jobs said in 1997, “You have to start from the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.”

In order to improve the customer experience using technology in a meaningful way, you’ll first need to find the best opportunities using a two step process.
