# Step two: Map the operational value stream

After mapping the customer experience, the next step is to identify improvement opportunities using operational [value stream ma](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bd9xRQQZfc-b9eTFUaAZQ7_KB7fiwk4MjWd5cErio_U/edit#)ps. These are used to document the steps, handoffs and delays that occur on the operational side of the customer experience. As shown in Figure N above, each step is measured in processing time and delay time with the total time represented by the “total lead time” metric.

Working through this process is a good way to shed light on where the longest wait times and processing times exist which in turn, will open up discussions around how to apply technology to potentially reduce those times. VSMs are useful because they help organizations improve the customer experience by measuring the “process time” needed to complete individual activities in the customer experience as well as measure the “lead time” needed to complete the entire flow end to end.

These measurements provide rich opportunities for organizations to improve the customer experience by combining strategy, product and user experience capabilities with engineering and data capabilities.
