# Summary

The thin-slice approach is one that we’ve used with success in our client work. The magic is in both getting a full cross-section of the organization working together from C-level to junior associate, and demonstrating the real business value this small slice can create. It’s important to reiterate that the approach we’ve outlined above is a sure-fire way to turn your original pod and coalition into engaged, happy promoters of your digital transformation. If your organization is struggling with employee engagement, implementing new ways of working is not a risk — it’s an approach you cannot afford to overlook.
