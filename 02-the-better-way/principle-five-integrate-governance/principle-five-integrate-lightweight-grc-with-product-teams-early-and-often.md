# Final thoughts

The three objectives of adaptive governance, as with all the principles in this book, are focused on pragmatism and achievable outcomes. Process as a solution for unpredictability is a recipe for failure: You will not anticipate the issues you may face that easily. It is better to be flexible in the face of change rather than to overly-architect the solution. Moreover, including governance in your core workflows is much more adaptable than hoping you can address the issues it raises at the end of a product build.
