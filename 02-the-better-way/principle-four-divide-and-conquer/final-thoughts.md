# Final thoughts

One of the most critical exercises in digital transformation, and one of the hardest to change, is ensuring that budgeting or portfolio management is no longer a static annual or quarterly exercise, but an evolvable, ongoing process that seeks to answer the question, “How can we make the best strategic investments, given what we know today, given the value of our existing investments, and our current constraints?”

The reality is, that when operating in a state of constant flux, it helps to structure the investment portfolio in an adaptive way that allocates your talent mix appropriately and bakes unpredictability into the planning and initiative evaluation process. Budgeting is ultimately about moving your resources where they’ll create the most value. When you have high-performing teams in place, enabling them with resources when and as they’re needed most becomes the key goal of an nimble budgeting process.
