# Final thoughts

At Rangle, the majority of the transformation work we do is brought to life through product teams. Through product teams, we are able to single-mindedly focus on the customer and bring [Principle One](../why-digital-transformation-is-important/introduction.md) \(_CVA\),_ and [Principle Two](../introduction.md) \(_technology as strategy\)_ to life.

In effect, product teams are the bridge between strategy and execution. But product teams can only be effective when they are focused on creating long term value for customers. In order to do this, they must be as unconstrained as possible with strong leaders in place — ready to unblock them, lobby on their behalf within the organization, and trust them to make the best possible decisions in support of the customer.

In [Part III](../part-iii-micro-transformation/introduction.md), we’ll explore the practical application of product teams as a pragmatic way to turn the transformation vision into action, and hopefully spur your enthusiasm for starting your transformation journey by demonstrating that it is possible!
