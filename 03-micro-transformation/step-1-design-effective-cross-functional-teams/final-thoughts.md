# Final thoughts

The coalitions and pods approach not only ensures that your digital transformation process begins well, but that it has the flywheel effect built in â€” your efforts will become faster with each successive pod as your coalition grows their expertise in partnering and coaching.

Choosing the right experts for your coalition will also ensure its success: Who in your organization is most adaptable to change? Who has the capacity to deal with ambiguity?

The resilience of the coalition will determine the success of the pod in choosing the right option for their growth, not just the first or most convenient-sounding one.
