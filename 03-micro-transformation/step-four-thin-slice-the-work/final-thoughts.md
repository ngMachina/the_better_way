# Final thoughts

Thin-slicing your organization allows you to test the viability of new modes of working in the fastest way possible. The pod-coalition microcosm inside your organization’s macrocosm is effectively a pressure-test — will the new ideas you’re introducing work in your larger business context? If the answer is yes from the results of your pod, there is the potential to move forward with the transformation effort with a great deal of confidence and trust in the process. Don’t underestimate the need for a feeling of psychological safety in this journey. Testing and learning can provide that peace of mind in your transformation efforts.
