# Why it works

Immersive working environments offer a lot of benefits for transforming organizations. Not only do they provide a safe and structured environment for learning, the group setting tends to increase collaboration and alleviate fear of change. Immersive working environments work well because they combine the best of process, product and technology thinking toward real-world organizational outcomes. Overall, the process works best when coalitions, pods and coaches have shared responsibility and accountability for the outcomes.

Moreover, as teams complete their twelve-week cycles, they often become evangelists and change agents, helping to promote the process as well as teach what theyâ€™ve learned to others, which further accelerates the rate of organizational change.
