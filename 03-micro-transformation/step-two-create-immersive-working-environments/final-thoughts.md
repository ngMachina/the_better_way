# Final thoughts

Rangle’s core mission is to build the right thing, the right way, and then improve it. The IWE model is not just theory for us — it’s how we work every day with our clients. We believe that immersion provides the absolute best working environment to achieve the digital-first, customer-first outcomes your business needs to transform and bring value to market faster.

Along with coaching comes something else your teams need in order to make the culture and mindset shift to the pods model: A safety net for failure. Working in a new way can be intimidating. The coaches provide not only assurance that the new ways are practical and achievable, but also make themselves available to discuss any misgivings the team may have as the process unfolds. They additionally provide a real ability to protect the teams from making common mistakes, and ensure that their work and decisions are ultimately successful.
