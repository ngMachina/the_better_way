# Final thoughts

When it comes to technology, nearly all established organizations have a similar set of challenges and opportunities. In digitally transforming your business, it’s important to think of technology as the strategic centerpiece, not just a service that ‘keeps the lights on’.

In fact, you need to think of your organization as a technology company— one that uses tech as a strategic asset to create the best customer experiences, and meaningful business outcomes. In our client work at Rangle, we instill technological excellence as a core value, iteratively reducing technical debt and increasing the flow of value to end users.

Finally, at the root of the strategy, are engineers — the creatives who provide the essential architectures, platforms and code that will power the strategy and transform the organization. Empower them, nurture them, and most importantly, use the five ideals noted in this section to create an environment that allows them to perform at their best.
