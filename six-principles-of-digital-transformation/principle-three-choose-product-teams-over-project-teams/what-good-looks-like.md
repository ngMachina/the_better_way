# What good looks like

* Product teams are autonomous and own the decisions making process end-to-end
* The product team mindset is applied to both internal and external products
* This mindset encapsulates paid customer facing offerings as well as everything that surrounds them \(i.e. website, datasets, infrastructure platforms, APIs, etc.\)
* Product teams target customer needs using a hypothesis-driven approach
