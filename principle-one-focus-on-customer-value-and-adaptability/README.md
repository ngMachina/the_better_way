# Principle one: Focus on customer value and adaptability

Focus on what your Customers Value and learn how to Adapt to a continuously uncertain world.

At Rangle, we call this principle CVA. It’s the first, and perhaps most important principle of _The Better Way_. It may also be the hardest to master, but it’s the most important component of a coherent digital transformation strategy because it’s the most effective way to align both strategy and execution around a common purpose.

As management guru Peter Drucker wrote back in 1954, “The purpose of a business is to create a customer”.

Many of the world’s leading companies by market capitalization also believe that value for customers is the number one priority. At Amazon, customer obsession is the name of the game. Jeff Bezos once wrote, “We have an unshakeable conviction that the long-term interests of shareowners are perfectly aligned with the interests of customers.”

That quote originated from an annual shareholder letter that Bezos wrote in 2010, at a time when Amazon’s stock price was approximately $185 dollars. As it turns out, Bezos just might have been on to something… Ten years later, Amazon’s stock would hit an all-time high of $3541.45, representing an increase of approximately 1800%.

Beyond Amazon, there are many other notable companies that have also found success by embracing customer value as its core ethos, including Apple, Walmart, Cisco, IKEA and Johnson & Johnson, to name a few.

But in order to stay relevant and remain competitive, knowing what customers value is only one side of the coin. The other side is adaptability: Viewing the world from the outside-in and continually questioning how customer needs and the market may evolve over time.

Here again, Bezos provides strong direction on how to work from the outside-in, using an approach that he calls working backward:

_“We start with the customer and we work backward. We learn whatever skills we need to service the customer. We build whatever technology we need to service the customer. The second thing is, we are inventors, so you won’t see us focusing on “me too” areas. We like to go down unexplored alleys and see what’s at the end. Sometimes they’re dead ends. Sometimes they open up into broad avenues and we find something really exciting. And then the third thing is, we’re willing to be long-term-oriented, which I think is one of the rarest characteristics. If you look at the corporate world, a genuine focus on the long term is not that common. But a lot of the most important things we’ve done have taken a long time.”_[_\[1\]_]()

_Note: In principle two, we’ll explain how to enable CVA by aligning the technology function to the business strategy._

Going a step further, the CVA principle not only provides a strong sense of purpose and direction, \(i.e. customers and capabilities\), but it also creates a powerful way for organizations to free up capital and resources by eliminating unaligned initiatives that do not ladder up to the broader goals of the organization. CVA also helps set the desired mindset for developing future initiatives.

It also ensures that the core competencies \(strategy, product, experience, engineering and data\) are always focused on customer outcomes that create business impact, rather than simply attaining functional excellence or improving performance against a plan. This is important because while the former tends to substantially improve business results, the latter tends to diminish them.

Despite the obvious benefits, making the shift to CVA can be difficult for organizations, because customer value is often seen by leaders as less tangible than traditional measures of success, like ROI.

The good news is that organizations don’t have to choose a side. They simply need to prioritize the measures differently. This means taking a leap of faith that amplifying customer value will ultimately amplify business value. In other words, CVA plays the leading role, while ROI plays the supporting role, acting as ballast to ensure each initiative in the organization's portfolio is financially sustainable.

_Pragmatic Insight:_

_CVA is a measured outcome that only works if an organization’s operating model and culture is based on customer-centric teams. Otherwise, organizational permission and friction tend to make CVA ‘someone else's’ responsibility. We use ‘culture’ here instead of environment, because it emerges from permission, capabilities, ambition, and shared goals and responsibilities. The word ‘environment’ doesn’t seem to do this justice. Refusing to compromise on CVA requires significant enablement and changes to how you work \(the essence of why transformation is needed\) and this can’t be found in just any design thinking or strategy process. Goals without change are wishful thinking intended to avoid the hard work of creating customer-obsessed teams that are enabled to create customer value._

In summary, the CVA principle enables transforming organizations in three ways:

1. CVA creates a single point of focus for both the business strategy and operating model
2. CVA and outside-in thinking enables organizations to discover new opportunities
3. CVA paves the way for new mental models to take root \(customers, capabilities, outcomes and impact\) vs. performance against a plan

Next, we’ll break down the CVA principle and show how it can be applied in practice. We’ll also provide a few examples to demonstrate what good looks like, as well define some of the most common failure modes.

## Applying the principle in practice:

To apply CVA in practice, start by visualizing your organization as an ecosystem of interdependent business functions like those shown in Figure N below.

Figure N: Example of an organizational ecosystem



## What good looks like:

* The executive vision embraces CVA as first and second order priorities
* The business strategy articulates the CVA based vision into coherent action
* The portfolio function distills the strategy into customer outcomes prioritized by value
* The product function translates customer outcomes into thin-sliced initiatives
* The delivery function uses modern delivery practices to rapidly gain customer feedback
* The measurement function continually evaluates business impact to influence strategy

## Common failure modes:

* Adopting CVA in principle while leaving the legacy operating model in place
* Creating slices that are too broad in scope
* Creating slices that fail to engage your full organizational ecosystem
* Using deterministic measures of success to gauge performance
* Targeting outputs over outcomes

_Pragmatic Insight:_

_CVA is ultimately about product creation as your primary business capability. Budget and schedule are legacy governance modes that destroy this capability. Using these measures, your teams will either: a\) Reimplement your last system with vague promises of achieving the higher-order customer experience goals “next year”, or they will b\) aggressively copy the best-in-class work of the last three years. In both cases, you don’t have a customer experience model that works in complex environments \(see Part I\), or that creates customer-obsessed teams that instead produce the work that others will copy in the future._

## Final thoughts:

The CVA principle’s utility is in providing an organizing principle and mindset that can be applied to any type of initiative. Whether it's a new business model invention, legacy business model differentiation or internal process improvement, the key is to always think about the benefit to customers first. That’s not to say that traditional measures of success like ROI and shareholder value are not important, because they are, but they are better suited to _guide_ investment decisions, rather than _direct_ them.

At Rangle, customer value and adaptability means adopting an outside-in strategy: Focusing each piece of your business on creating value for your customers, and continually adapting to change. It’s an organizing principle and a mindset shift that can be applied with success to any kind of initiative. By placing the customer value at the heart of the business model, it becomes impossible to stagnate, resist change, and lag in the adoption of best-in-class tools and practices.

In the next section, you’ll gain a clearer understanding of why technology must be central to your business strategy, and how it can get you closer to your customer.
