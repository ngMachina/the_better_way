# Common failure modes

* Adopting CVA in principle while leaving the legacy operating model in place
* Creating slices that are too broad in scope
* Creating slices that fail to engage your full organizational ecosystem
* Using deterministic measures of success to gauge performance
* Targeting outputs over outcomes

_**Pragmatic Insight:**_

_CVA is ultimately about product creation as your primary business capability. Budget and schedule are legacy governance modes that destroy this capability. Using these measures, your teams will either: a\) Re-implement your last system with vague promises of achieving the higher-order customer experience goals “next year”, or they will b\) aggressively copy the best-in-class work of the last three years. In both cases, you don’t have a customer experience model that works in complex environments \(see_ [_Part I_](../why-digital-transformation-is-important/introduction.md)_\), or that creates customer-obsessed teams that instead produce the work that others will copy in the future._
